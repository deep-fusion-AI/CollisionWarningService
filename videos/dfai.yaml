# Few points on horizon where the FIRST point marks
# the direction of X axis (or -X) of the vehicle
# These points were measured manually in the image
# There are 3 distinct cases:
# * no points (missing field) - assumed vanishing point in image center and zero roll
# * single point - assumed zero roll
# * Multiple points - full rotation
